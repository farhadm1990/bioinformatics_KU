# bioinformatics_KU
A repository for the crash-course on microbial (meta)genomics at the University of Copenhagen


## This course will cover two main tools:

# 1. MicroLoop:

<p>Microbiome data analysis has posed many challenges on the researchers and decision-making entities, due to its complexity and hefty work that comes with it. In addition, due to lack of a golden standard for this type of sparce data analysis reproducibility of the results from lab to lab might be jeopardized. Therefore, MicroLoop was developed as a shiny app in R to perfom a wide variety of task with no need for hard-coding and any demanding bioinformatics skills.</p>
